oneframework
============

SASS Responsive Framework built without the bloat

This is simplistic and modular approach to building small to mid-sized applications. It makes use of SASS partials that are easily customizable on the fly, while making it easy to write front-end code without the hassle of having to overwrite all of the aspects of the framework itself.

You can add your own partials to oneframework, and then just import them via oneframework.scss. You can also remove any partials without breaking the application since the code is kept generic.

The Partial Directory:

- Headers
- Navigation
- Responsive Navigation
- Typography
- Mixins
- Variables
- Reset
- Print

We left the Responsive Grid out so that it could be interchangable on a per application basis.
